          URL Shortener with Telegram Group Security and Malicious URL Detection
        </h1>
        <p>
          LangIN is an "URL Shortener application" integrated with "Telegram
          group security analysis" and "malicious URL and webpages detection".
          The aim of the application is to provide a service that shortens URLs,
          monitors Telegram groups for potentially harmful URLs, and flags or
          blocks malicious ones.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          The application utilizes various tools and models, including LLMs for
          automating workflows, Virus Detection and Safe Browsing APIs for URL
          safety checks, and Implementations for Telegram Security Analysis.
          Additionally, the system will serve as a "detection tool for illegal
          activities" on Telegram, where it extracts URLs from messages,
          shortens them, and verifies their safety against known phishing,
          malware, or blacklisted domains.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Along with this LangIN provides analysis such as number of people who
          have used the link, a heatmap of where all this link was accessed (We
          respect your privacy, hence the heatmap and not a navigation map) so
          as to give the user a sense of safety check that others have used and
          verified this link as safe.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          LangIN also provides a concise summary of what is available on the
          webpage or url trying to be accessed. This gives the users (You) a
          preview of whether what you are looking for is what is on the webpage.
          Also the colored border on the summary isn't just for decoration. The
          color depicts the threat level of the URL posted. As we all know{" "}
          <b>
            Green is "safe", Yellow is "Moderate" and Red is a "Definite No Go".{" "}
          </b>
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          We also provide a few links which cover similar topics that is on the
          url that was provided. Also Logging in saves all your shortened url
          along with their descriptions for you to revisit just in case.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          <strong>JUST A QUICK GUIDE:</strong> The button with the upward facing
          arrow just provides a shortened URL and you don't really need to be
          logged in to use this feature. The other button with the chart-logo
          provides a detailed analysis of the URL you are trying to access in
          the dashboard section. To access this feature, you need to be logged
          in.
        </p>
